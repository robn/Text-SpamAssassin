==================================================================
     THE NASTY, BRUTISH, AND SHORT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
          (or "So you want to be a rock'n'roll star?")
==================================================================

1) Unpack the archive.

2) Read the documentation. See babycart.html, babycart.txt, or
`perldoc ./babycart` for usage.

3) Install the Mail::SpamAssassin perl module (aka SpamAssassin)
and verify it's working (read the docs, run the test suite, etc.,
etc.)

4a) (SA < 3.x) Install the Mail::SpamAssassin::SpamCopURI perl
module (aka SpamAssassin) and verify it's working (read the docs,
run the test suite, etc., etc.)

4b) (SA >= 3.x) Enable the SpamCopURI plugin for SpamAssassin
(included in 3.x distribution) and verify it's working (read the
docs, run the test suite, etc., etc.)

5) Run the babycart test suite (run_test_suite.sh) and compare it
to the results in suite_results.txt

6) Adjust scores in comment_spam_prefs.cf

7) (Build a plugin for/modify) your blog software to pass new
comments to babycart and set the moderation flag on the post if it
is flagged as spam. For perl-based blogs, look directly at the
babycart source code. For php-based blogs, look at
comment_tester.php. For Java, .NET, and other blogs, you're on
your own.

Caveat utilitor and bon chance!

Cash, patches, and effusive thanks graciously accepted...
