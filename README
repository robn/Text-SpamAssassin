Text/SpamAssassin version 1.3
==============================

Text::SpamAssassin - Detects spamminess of arbitrary text, suitable
for wiki and blog defense.

Text::SpamAssassin accepts textual content and metadata (comment
title, poster's name, email address, url, and IP address), and
produces a RFC822-formatted mail message for analysis with
Mail::SpamAssassin. Additionally, new rule­ sets and user
preferences can be passed to Mail::SpamAs­ sassin to adjust the
rules and scores applied to the mail message, since certain tests
bear no relevance to comment spam (e.g. DUL network tests, Bayesian
classifier.)

Results include verdict (OK or SUSPICIOUS), note (shows whether
tests completed successfully), score, and rules (the list of rules
hit.)

See ./contrib for proof-of-concept PHP code and its counterpart, the
standalone script 'babycart'.
